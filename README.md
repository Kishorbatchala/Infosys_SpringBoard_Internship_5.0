Human Stress Detection and Prediction Using ANN
Problem Statement:
Develop a system that utilizes physiological data to detect and classify human stress levels during sleep. The project employs an 
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to perform binary classification of sleep data into "Stressed" or "Not Stressed."

Outcomes:
Data Utilization:
Physiological metrics: heart rate, respiratory rate, and body movements recorded during sleep.
Classification Labels:
Binary: 1 = Stressed, 0 = Not Stressed.
Model Output:
Predicts sleep-based stress levels.
Performance Evaluation:
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to gauge effectiveness.
Data Visualizations:
Insights into data distribution, training progress, and model performance using charts and plots.
This system aims to provide a robust, interpretable solution for stress detection, enabling actionable insights into sleep-based stress management.
